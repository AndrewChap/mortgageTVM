# mortgageTVM
A mortgage calculator that accounts for the Time-Value of Money (TVM).  See [this Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/AndrewChap/mortgagetvm/blob/master/notebooks/mortgage-tvm-demo.ipynb) for an explanation of how and why.

## Web Application
I am currently working on a web application (not publicy available, but [here on GitHub](https://github.com/AndrewChap/mortgage-app)) to make this available to the masses.
